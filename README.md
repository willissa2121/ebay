##for this application, the user can use the terminal and command line prompts to act as either a customer, manager, or supervisor to the department store. The "Store" in question is two seperate MYSQL database tables. The first table shows all products that are available to purchase, as well as the cost to buy them as a customer, cost to buy as the manager (for the stores inventory), the current inventory, the total earnings, and the total costs. The second table contains all of the departments. This table will show the total earnings, total cost, and net profit for each department.
